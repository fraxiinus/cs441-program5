Our team wanted to create an app to allow players of the popular game "League of Legends" to draw on the game map to help visualize in game strategies. We brainstormed features and split up work to implement each feature. The app consists of an image of the in-game minimap and a toolbar consisting of buttons, where each button enables the user to interact with the minimap in a certain way. We've named the app LeagueBoard.

----Features----
1. Pen tool
  - allows the user to touchdown on the minimap and draw
  - upon selecting the pen tool, the user is given the option to change the pen's color by using the seekbars
  - the user can also change the size of the pen stroke
2. Champion icons
  - allows the user to place small images of in-game champion icons on the map
  - upon selecting this tool, the user can select which champion they would like to place
  - a switch is available to change the image to display it is an enemy champion
3. Ward icons
  - allows the user to place ward images on the map
  - very similar to champion icons feature
4. Clear tool
  - clears the map of all drawings and icons
